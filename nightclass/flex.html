#flex-flow lets you space things dynamically as the screen size changes; you can also use
#media queries for this. flex-grow defines the ability for elements to grow.Flex shrink is the opposite. If you want to do it
#in one line of code, use flex: (grow) (shrink) (flex-basis[size in pixels; default is auto, which will size it to the div size])
